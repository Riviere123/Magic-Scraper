# Magic-Scraper
Scrapes the webpage (https://scryfall.com/sets) for all magic the gathering set names and uses these set names to navigate the site to each page with all the cards in the given set.


When run it will create the subset directories(named after the sets) in the same directory as MTG Card Scraper.py and then download each card image and name them accordingly. If there are duplicate named cards it will numericly increment the name of the card so you will get all image copys.
